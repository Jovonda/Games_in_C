## Hiragana Quiz game
### Description
This is a short hiragana quiz game, it does not contain any dakuten, handakuten, or any of the glides. 
This is just the basic 46 hirgana characters along with their basic 46 romaji counter parts.
You will be given options for either inputting hirgana characters for romaji and vice versus.
There is a joke option if you cannot make up your mind.
There are two options depending on where in the program you decided not to input a 'Y' or 'N' when asked.
### How to run
This was coded using the Windows Subsystem for Linux with the use of Ubuntu.
In the terminal, use : gcc game.c -o game, or what ever name you perfer for instead like " gcc game.c -o 'Insert your own file name here' "
### Reason for using Ubuntu
I am able to show Japanese Characters on the terminal using Ubuntu, I had trouble doing this with Windows commandline, and I am not familiar with Mac.
